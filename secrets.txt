I changed the settings.py by taking out the "SECRET_KEY" litereal and have Django read it from an 
enviroment variable. 

I made sure the image could not run w/o the SECRET_KEY. When running "kubectl get pods" :

NAME                                         READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
assignment3-django-deploy-5db4f954dc-n4mvd   0/1     CrashLoopBackOff   10         2d22h
mysql-container-6c6466b64c-lrm4w             1/1     Running            2          2d22h
proxy-6dcd56d44d-wh9j9                       1/1     Running            2          2d22h

The django pod is not running since django needs the SECRET_KEY to run. 

Following the kuberenetes secrets documentation, I created a yaml file specifically for the django
SECRET_KEY using base64 program to encode it as per the documentation:

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
        name: django-secret-key
    type: Opaque
    data:
        secretKey: a21neXNhI2Z6KzkoejEqPWMweWRyaml6ayo3c3RobTJnYTF6ND1eNjE=

I modified the django-deploy.yaml file to set the enviroment variable so django could find it: 

          env:   
            - name: DJANGO_SECRET_KEY
              valueFrom: 
                secretKeyRef: 
                    name: django-secret-key 
                    key: secretKey 

After rebuilding the docker images and restarting the minikube, the web application was working again. 
while editing the django-delpoy.yaml I realized the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD was visible in plain text 
within the configuration file in GiftcardSite/k8/django-delpoy and db/k8/db-delpoyment so I moved it 
to its own seperate file similarly to how I did it above. 

I created a mysql-pwd.yaml file with contents:

        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        metadata:
            name: mysql-pwd
        type: Opaque
        data:
            password: dGhpc2lzYXRlc3R0aGluZy4=


I modified the django-deploy.yaml file: 

          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                    name: mysql-pwd
                    key: password


Looking at views.py, I did not find any more secrets.
