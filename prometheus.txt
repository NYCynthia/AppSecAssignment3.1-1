Remove unwanted monitoring

In views.py I commented out lines 47-52 (in the final version of the file) because while viewing the metrics, it would display the password in plain text.  
        
        # KG: Uh... I'm not sure this makes sense.
        # Collect data to ensure good password use.
        # if pword not in graphs.keys():
        #     graphs[pword] = Counter(f'counter_{pword}', 'The total number of '\
        #       + f'times {pword} was used')
        # graphs[pword].inc()

Expand reasonable monitoring

As requested, database 404 errors were added to the prometheus counters:

line 28-29
        graphs['db_counter'] = Counter('database_error_return_404', 'The total number'\
        + ' of 404 error messages')

I added the following line of code to these lines in the file: 103, 109, 155, 161
        graphs['db_counter'].inc()


Add Prometheus

I found instructions to add prometheus to kubernetes and got it up and running: https://devopscube.com/setup-prometheus-monitoring-on-kubernetes/

Next I needed to delete the minikube to rebuild the image: 
        minikube delete

Then i rebuilt the minikube using my rekube.sh script:
        sh rekube.sh

Since migrate and seeding are now seperate jobs, I needed to migrate the database just to run the web server:
        kubectl apply -f migrate/migrate-db-job.yaml

        Cynthias-MacBook-Pro-2:AppSecAssignment3.1 queenc$ kubectl get pods
        NAME                                        READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
        assignment3-django-deploy-8bf5b76f5-4lm97   1/1     Running     0          9m5s
        migrate-vv726                               0/1     Completed   0          6s
        mysql-container-77676c4fcc-jbw8q            1/1     Running     1          9m6s
        proxy-6dcd56d44d-mqxbd                      1/1     Running     3          9m5s

Then I was able to load the web application but could not buy anything since the database was empty, this produced 
the database 404 errors we wanted to monitor from 3.2. Then I seeded the database with the job I created before:
        kubectl apply -f migrate/seed-db.yaml 

        Cynthias-MacBook-Pro-2:AppSecAssignment3.1 queenc$ kubectl get pods
        NAME                                        READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
        assignment3-django-deploy-8bf5b76f5-4lm97   1/1     Running     0          13m
        migrate-vv726                               0/1     Completed   0          4m54s
        mysql-container-77676c4fcc-jbw8q            1/1     Running     1          13m
        proxy-6dcd56d44d-mqxbd                      1/1     Running     3          13m
        seed-db-67qzs                               0/1     Completed   0          5s

Then I registered a user, logged in, bought several giftcards and used some of them.
